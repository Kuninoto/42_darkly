### Where:  

`/`

### How:  

1. Inspect page source in main page's footer
2. See the social media links (redirects)
3. Decide to try to change the `site` param to another page
4. Found!

### Fixable by:  

1. Validating if the destination site is the supposed one / whitelisted OR if the redirect doesn't need to be dynamic, simply have it as a direct link on the page
