### Where:  

`/robots.txt` and `/.hidden`

### How:  

1. Noticed a huge amount of folders with READMEs with repetitive phrases
2. Decided and developed a [script](https://github.com/Kuninoto/42_darkly/blob/master/unknown7/Resource/explore.py) to recursively walk the directories  
and read every README file encountered along the way, searching for one with a content different from the repetitive ones 
3. Found!
